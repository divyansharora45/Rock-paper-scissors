Problem Statement: Console-Based Rock Paper Scissors

Objective

Develop a Python program that allows a user to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer via the command line interface (CLI). The game should run continuously until the user decides to quit.

Core Game Rules

Rock beats Scissors.

Scissors beats Paper.

Paper beats Rock.

If both players choose the same option, it is a Tie.

Functional Requirements

1. Input Handling

The program must accept user input from the console.

Inputs should be case-insensitive (e.g., "Rock", "rock", "ROCK").

The program should support flexible inputs. For example, if the user types "r" or "ro", the system should interpret this as "Rock".

If the user enters invalid text (e.g., "banana"), the program should notify the user and ask for input again without crashing.

The user must be able to exit the game by entering 0.

2. Computer Logic

The computer must select its move randomly from the three available options (Rock, Paper, Scissors).

3. Win Determination

Implement a function win_dec(user, computer) to compare the moves.

Optional Challenge: Attempt to implement the win logic using integer mapping (e.g., assigning -1, 0, 1 to moves) instead of writing 9 distinct if/else conditions.

4. Game Loop

The game must not exit after a single round. It should ask for the user's choice repeatedly until the exit command is given.

Sample Output

--- Rock Paper Scissors ---
Enter '0' to exit

Your choice: rock
You chose: rock
Computer's choice: scissors
User Wins!

Your choice: p
You chose: paper
Computer's choice: paper
It's a tie!

Your choice: 0
Thanks for playing!


Constraints

Use standard Python libraries (e.g., random).

Ensure the code is modular (use functions for input handling and win logic).
